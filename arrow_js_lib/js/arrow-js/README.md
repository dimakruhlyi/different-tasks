Arrow.js is a tiny library (4.5kb gzipped) for displaying an arrow pointing to the browser download location. Perfect for pointing at that new file you downloaded!

### Get Started

Include the javascript in your HTML

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/ArrowJS/src/js/arrow.js">
```

Or use the minified version

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/ArrowJS/dist/arrow-0.1.9.min.js">
```

### Installing with Bower

Bower requires [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). 

    bower install arrow-js --save

### How to use

#### API

```javascript
//Display the Arrow for 5 seconds
//
//@param milliseconds {integer} Show the arrow for this many milliseconds then fade
//out. Defaults to 6000 milliseconds (6 seconds)
Arrow.show(5000);
```

#### Properties

```javascript
//Get Arrow.js Version
Arrow._version;

//Get Current Browser
Arrow._browser;

//Get Current Browser Version
Arrow._browserVersion 
```

### Browser Support

Chrome 4+, Firefox 3.5+, IE 8+, Edge (Windows 10), Safari

* The Firefox download manager was introduced in version 23 so the arrow will point in the top right.

* Chrome downloads start at the bottom left of the page.

* IE 9/10 downloads start in the bottom center.

* IE 8 downloads come up in the center of the screen unless the security warnings comes up at the top of the page. So the arrow points at the top left.
